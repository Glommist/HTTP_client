That trend has continued in 2021, according to the latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. Concentration of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, reached 413.2 parts per million in 2020 and is 149 per cent of the pre-industrial level. Methane is 262 per cent of the level in 1750 when human activities started disrupting the Earth\u2019s natural equilibrium. The economic slowdown from COVID-19 did not have any discernible impact on atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates, although there was a temporary decline in new emissions. Roughly half of carbon dioxide emitted by human activities today remains in the atmosphere. The other half is taken up by oceans and land ecosystems, but their ability to act as \u201csinks\u201d may become less effective in the future.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&amp;id=21975\">WMO Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/climate-change-triggers-mounting-food-insecurity-poverty-and-displacement-africa\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/state-of-the-climate-report2021.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>WMO and others | The State of the Climate in Africa 2020</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">19 October 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This report provides a snapshot of climate change trends and impacts in Africa, including sea level rise and the melting of the continent\u2019s iconic glaciers.

Some, such as continued sea-level rise, are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years. The report points to strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to limit climate change. Benefits for air quality would come quickly, while global temperatures would take 20-30 years to stabilize. The report, issued by the IPCC\u2019s Working Group I and approved by 195 member governments, is the first in a series leading up to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.

SAI has been proposed as a potential method to reduce climate warming by increasing sunlight reflection.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/system/files/documents/Scientific-Assessment-of-Ozone-Depletion-2022-Executive-Summary.pdf\">Executive Summary</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/global-peatlands-assessment-2022\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/202210_gpa_the_state_of_the_worlds_peatlands_09_main.jpeg\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>UNEP | The State of the World\u2019s Peatlands</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">17 November 2022</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Global Peatlands Assessment, which is the most comprehensive assessment to-date, shows that the Earth is losing 500,000 hectares of peatlands a year, while already drained and degraded peatlands contribute around 4 per cent of annual global human-induced emissions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/global-peatlands-assessment-2022\">UNEP Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&amp;id=22158#.Y3JI8HbMKHu\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/state-of-the-climate-asia.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>WMO | State of the Climate in Asia 2021</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">14 November 2022</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The State of the Climate in Asia 2021 report highlights how climate change impacts are wreaking an ever-increasing human, financial and environmental toll, worsening food insecurity and poverty and holding back sustainable development.

Addressing the rising climate risks and associated impacts requires local, regional and transnational capacity building, development of climate services and integrated disaster risk reduction approaches.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&amp;id=21990#.YZwEz2DMLIU\">WMO Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/step-climate-change-adaptation-efforts-or-face-huge-disruption-un\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/11/agr-cover.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>UNEP| The Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">1 November 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A new report calls for urgent efforts to increase the financing and implementation of actions to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. While policies and planning are increasing for climate change adaptation, financing and implementation are still far behind. Moreover, countries have largely missed the opportunity to use the pandemic recovery to prioritize green economic growth and adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, storms and wildfire. The report finds that the costs of adaptation are likely in the higher end of an estimated $140-300 billion per year by 2030 and $280-500 billion per year by 2050 for developing countries only. Estimated adaptation costs in developing countries are five to 10 times greater than current public adaptation finance flows, and the gap is widening.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/step-climate-change-adaptation-efforts-or-face-huge-disruption-un\" id=\"report-button\">UNEP Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"http://climatepromise.undp.org/state-of-climate-ambition\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/state-climate-ambition-report-cover.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>UNDP| Showing Promise: The State of Climate Ambition</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">21 October 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Paris Agreement\u2019s \u201cratchet mechanism\u201d, where countries regularly recalibrate and increase the ambition of climate goals, is working according to this report. But small island developing States and least developed countries are leading the way on greater ambition despite contributing only a marginal share of global emissions. The report stresses that it is time for the G20 countries to step up given that they emit the most. In reviewing the most recent national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions, the report finds that they are higher quality, more inclusive and country driven than in an earlier round. But finance remains a key hurdle. While countries are increasingly engaging the private sector as critical to scaled up climate action, they are not adequately defining needs in just transition processes. Issues related to gender equality and youth feature more prominently yet more needs to be done to capitalize on the potential of these groups as climate actors and leaders.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"http://climatepromise.undp.org/state-of-climate-ambition\" id=\"report-button\">UNDP Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/weather-and-climate-extremes-asia-killed-thousands-displaced-millions-and-cost\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/captura_de_tela_2021-10-26_as_12.11.38.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>WMO and others | The State of the Climate in Asia 2020</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">26 October 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Extreme weather and climate change impacts across Asia in 2020 caused the loss of life of thousands of people, displaced millions of others and cost hundreds of billions of dollars, while wreaking a heavy toll on infrastructure and ecosystems.

This provides hope that further action could still head off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. But net-zero pledges are vague and incomplete in many cases. To stay at no more than 1.5\u00b0C, the world has eight years to take an additional 28 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent off annual emissions, above what has already been promised.

They include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.

With economies worldwide ravaged by COVID-19, primary energy demand fell by 4 per cent. Yet G20 countries, the planet\u2019s biggest polluters, barely met or even missed their unambitious renewable energy targets. The Renewables 2021 Global Status Report shows that the world is nowhere near the necessary paradigm shift towards a clean, healthier and more equitable energy future, even as the benefits of renewables are indisputable. In many regions, it is now cheaper to build new wind or solar PV plants than to operate existing coal-fired power plants. The report suggests accelerating the uptake of renewable energy by making it a key performance indicator for every economic activity, budget and public purchase, and adopting clear targets and plans to shift to renewable energy and end fossil fuel use.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://www.ren21.net/gsr/\">Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/SBTi-TakingtheTemperatureReport2021.pdf\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/taking-the-temperature.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>CDB and the UN Global Compact | Taking the Temperature</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">10 June 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>New research finds that the G7 stock indexes are not currently on a 2\u00b0C pathway, much less the 1.5\u00b0C one that is so urgently needed.

The report underscores the strong reliance of economies on nature, particularly in low-income countries. It highlights that sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia would suffer the greatest GDP contractions at 9.7 per cent and 6.5 per cent annually, respectively. This is due to a reliance on pollinated crops and, in sub-Saharan Africa, on forest products, as well as a limited ability to switch to other production and consumption options that would be less affected.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link  pull-right\" href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/445311625065610639/a-global-earth-economy-model-to-assess-development-policy-pathways\">World Bank Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<!-- Report -->\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/sites/default/files/2021-06/20210609_workshop_report_embargo_3pm_CEST_10_june_0.pdf\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/ipbes-and-ipcc.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>IPBES and IPCC | Biodiversity and Climate Change</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">9 June 2021</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unprecedented changes in climate and biodiversity, driven by human activities, have combined and increasingly threaten nature, human lives, livelihoods and well-being around the world.

The report finds that in 2022, investments in nature-based solutions totaled approximately $200 billion, but finance flows to activities directly harming nature were more than 30 times larger. It exposes a concerning disparity between the volumes of finance to nature-based solutions and nature-negative finance flows, and underscores the urgency to address the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation. The report suggests that simply doubling or tripling investment in nature-based solutions will not be sufficient to reach the three Rio targets unless the almost $7 trillion finance flows to nature-negative practices are dramatically reduced and ideally repurposed in favor of nature.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link  pull-right\" href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2023\">Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/state-finance-nature-2022\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/state-of-finance-22.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>UNEP | The 2022 State of Finance for Nature report</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">1 December 2022</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The State of Finance for Nature report underpins that with sufficient finance, nature-based solutions provide benefits that contribute to climate, biodiversity and land restoration goals in an integrated manner while also promoting human wellbeing.

The report provides UN system-wide and entity-level data on environmental impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions, climate neutrality, waste, air pollution, water and wastewater, and biodiversity. It found that the UN system in 2020 generated approximately 25 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than in 2019, given significant worldwide travel restrictions and many UN personnel working from home. In 2020, 19 per cent of UN electricity worldwide came from renewable energy. The UN system was able to offset 99 per cent of emissions. While offsetting is important in managing unavoidable emissions, the priority for the UN system remains emissions reductions and elimination.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"view-more-link pull-right\" href=\"https://www.greeningtheblue.org\" id=\"report-button\">UNEP Report</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"row bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><a href=\"https://www.greeningtheblue.org/reports/greening-blue-report-2020\"><img alt=\"Report Cover\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020/12/greening_the_blue_report_2020_cover.png\"></a></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>UNEP | Greening the Blue 2020</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">10 December 2020</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The United Nations has released its latest annual stocktaking on its environmental impact.&nbsp;Greening the Blue 2020&nbsp;finds a downward trend in emissions for nearly 60 UN system entities and 310,000 staff members.
